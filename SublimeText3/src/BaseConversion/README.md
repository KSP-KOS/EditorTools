# Functional Copy of Xeger's Atom Package

The two files in this subdirectory are the original ports of xeger's Atom package without any of the additions or major functional changes of my version. These files are provided if you only want a direct port, or if you want a baseline for making your own alterations.

The only difference are formatting changes resulting from the conversion to a `.YAML` file, and slight alterations to the regex search for comments and strings.  These changes invoke the same syntax highlighting behavior found in the Atom package.
